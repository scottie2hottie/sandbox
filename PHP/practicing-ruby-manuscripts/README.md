## Practicing Ruby: Manuscripts archive

This is a collection of publicly released articles from the [Practicing
Ruby](http://practicingruby.com) journal.

You are welcome to use these materials as you see fit, as long as you 
abide by the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 
Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license.

Make sure to include a clear reference to practicingruby.com anywhere you make 
use of these materials. It'd also be nice for you to link to 
http://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/practicing-ruby-manuscripts so
that others can find these source materials, but that is optional.

Please see the AUTHORS.md file in this repository for copyright information.

For any questions, please contact gregory@practicingruby.com. I am especially
interested in hearing from folks who would like to translate these articles into
other languages (both spoken languages and programming languages!), but I'd love
to hear from anyone who wishes to make use of these materials for any purpose.

## To support my work, please subscribe at practicingruby.com

I believe that it's only right for me to release my articles for free after a
reasonable amount of time has passed, but this project is still a TON of work,
and would not exist without my subscribers. You can get access to a lot more
articles and make it possible for me to keep publishing by signing up for a paid
account. It's only $8/month, and it's totally worth it.
