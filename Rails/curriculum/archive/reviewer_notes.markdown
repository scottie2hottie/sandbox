title: Reviewer Notes
---

* look into more detailed notes about Ubuntu & RVM (issue with IF statements in bash_profile)
* no kicking ass (ex: git)
* routing/redirect: useful for pointing to external things like an omniauth middleware
* Break out my opinion parts like "In my style..." into separate box
* How does this get presented? Talk through, then flip to example code/app, and the speaker implements, hopefully same as practice app
* Add setup instructions for chrome/selenium to JS Testing unit
* Create an invoice
* Next steps: Morning of Friday the 5th -- 10:00AM Chicago Time on Friday 8/5
* I'll setup static HTML site for the review call and send out URL
