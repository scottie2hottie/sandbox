## Day 1 - Ruby Exercises

After you’ve completed Ruby in 100 Minutes, it’s time to start doing more difficult exercises. Read and work through the packet whose first page says “Exercise 11: Asking Questions.” As you complete sections and exercises please show them to an instructor so we can record your work.

The reading and questions can be downloaded here: http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/codenow/codenow_programming_exercises.pdf

### Exercise 11: Asking Questions

* Show us your completed “ext11.rb” like the bottom of the page
* Add in two new questions of your own and add them to the output 

### 7.2 Branching

* Demonstrate the program on page 46 about Mrs. Gabbard 

### 7.3 Looping

* Demonstrate the small while-loop program on the bottom of page 50 

### 7.5 A Few Things to Try (page 57)

* Create a program that correctly prints “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall”
* Create a “deaf grandma” program
* Extra Credit: Add in the changes from the “Deaf Grandma Extended” 

### Exercise 31: Making Decisions (page 79)

* Type up and run the program just as it is on page 79/80 so it matches the “What You Should See” section
* Modify the program to add in three new features or questions/responses

### 10.1 Recursion (page 82)

* Build and test the factorial program on page 84
* Build and test the mapping program on page 87
* Expand the mapping program to a grid of 16x16 with your own land design. Can it count the land tiles correctly?
* Figure out the “ZERO!” fix described on page 88 and build it into your program. Demonstrate that it works by creating and counting a map with land touching the edge.

### 10.2 Rite of Passage: Sorting (page 88)

* Build and test a recursive sorting algorithm as described from page 88 to 90. Prove that it works with an array of 10 unsorted numbers.

### 10.3 A Few Things to Try (page 90)

* Build and test the “dictionary sort” described in the second bullet paragraph. Prove it works with an array of ten words using mixed lowercase and capital letters
