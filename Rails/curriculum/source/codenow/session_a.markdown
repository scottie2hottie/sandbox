title: CodeNow Session A
---

## Day 1

### Opening

Introduce students to the idea of writing instructions through the PB&J exercises.

Set expectations by explaining what goes into programming something as complex as a video game and give them an idea of what to expect during CodeNow sessions.

### Hackety Hack

Introduce students to Hackety-Hack and ask them to work through the tutorials and complete [the additional exercises here](hackety_hack_exercises.pdf) as they finish each chapter.

If quick students need an additional challenge, consider asking them to create a calculator using text fields and buttons in Hackety Hack.

## Day 2

### Ruby in 100 Minutes

Work through [Ruby in 100 Minutes](/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes) for most of the morning. 

If possible, finish the morning with a demo of Arduinos in action.

### Ruby & Dino

Walk through the [Arduino & Dino Projects](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/arduino/introducing_arduino.html). All students should at least complete the number guessing game.
