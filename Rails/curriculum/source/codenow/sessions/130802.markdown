## Welcome, Kareem!

Today Kareem Grant will be running the show.

## Warmup

Please spend half an hour working on an exercise from Exercism on your own.

## Student & Kareem Pairing

Kareem will pick a student from the group and pair program for half an hour on your current Exercism challenge in front of the class.

## Finishing Merchant

Our goal today is to get [the Merchant project]{% page_url merchant %} finished. Most of your have I5 or I6 in progress -- let's see if we can get through I7 and have fully-functioning stores.

### JavaScript Add-ons

If you'd like to work with JavaScript, consider those ideas you saw earlier this week for extra flourish:

* Make the product description collapsable like you did with JSRights
* Insert a copyright line at the bottom of the page using jQuery that automatically fills in today's year (ex: "Copyright Jumpstart Lab, 2013")
* Create a "cheat code" for your store: if the user is on a product page and types your name into the keyboard, then the price drops to $0.01!

## Demos

You've built some great Merchant projects this week. Kareem will pick three to show off parts they're particularly proud of.

## Retrospective

[Hop over to the retrospective for Week 5]({% page_url codenow/retrospectives/week_5 %})
