## Starting the Merchant Project

Have you ever used an online store? Let's build our own.

### How is a Store Built?

Let's first talk about how a store is constructed:

* Product Listings
* Shopping Carts
* Orders
* Shipping Information
* Administrator Interface

### Starting Into the Project

With that understanding in place, let's [start the Merchant project]({% page_url projects/merchant %}).

Today we want to get through the creation of at least Products and Categories.

## Demos

This afternoon let's show off some work. Have a great Blogger? Do something interesting with MiniTest?

## Retrospective

[Hop over to the retrospective for Week 4]({% page_url codenow/retrospectives/week_4 %})
