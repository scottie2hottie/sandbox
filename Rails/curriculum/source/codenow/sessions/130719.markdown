## Finish Phase 1 of Blogger

This morning our goal is to get through at least I5 ("Authentication") on the Blogger project.

Next week we'll add more features to the blog, but if you finish I5 go ahead and try out some of the suggestions listed under "Extras" in the tutorial.

## Demos

Let's show off some work. The instructor will select a few great projects to show off.
