## Fundamental Git

This morning we'll start off learning about the Git source control system.

### Discussion

* What is Source Control?
* Why do you need it?
* Who uses it?
* What happens if you don't use source control?
* Where does git itself come from?
* How are Git and GitHub related?
* Do I really have to learn/use git?
* What's great and what's not so great about git?
  * Challenging command line syntax
  * Very flexible, maybe too flexible
  * Great at branching and merging
  * Distributed so no single point of failure
* Defining Terms
  * Repository/repo
  * Remote
  * Push
  * Pull
  * Fork
  * Branch
  * Merge
  * Commit

### Getting Git on Your Machine

There's no additional setup for git on your laptop because the Rails Installer already installed it for you!

To test it out:

* Open a command prompt window
* Enter `git --version`
* See something like `git version 1.8.1.1` (the actual version number isn't important)

You're ready to go!

### Learning How to Use It

There's a great web-based tutorial that will walk you through the fundamentals.

* Open http://try.github.io/ in your web browser
* Work through each of the exercises

### Getting Started with GitHub

We're going to use GitHub to post and share your source code.

#### Register for an Account

* Open https://github.com/signup/free
* Register for an account

#### Your First GitHub Repo

Once you're into GitHub, let's create a repository for your ProcessArtist project and push the code up!

On GitHub's website:

* Look in the top right for an icon that has a book and a `+` on it. Click that.
* In "repository name" enter "process_artist"
* Leave the other options as they are and click "Create Repository"

Your repo is created. Now we need to push your code up.

#### Creating the Local Repo

Now let's work on pushing your code from your laptop to GitHub:

* Open a command prompt
* Use `cd` to get into your ProcessArtist directory
* Type `git init` to create the git repo
* Type `git add .` to add all the files in the current directory
* Type `git commit -m "First version of ProcessArtist"` to commit the code

Now your code is in a local repo and it's time to push to GitHub.

* Add your SSH key to GitHub (Steve will have to show you how to do this)
* Copy the address of your repo from the GitHub page, it'll look like `git@github.com:your_user_name/process_artist.git`
* In the command prompt add that URL as a remote like this: `git remote add origin git@github.com:your_username/process_artist.git`
* Push the code to that remote `git push origin master`

You're done! You should be able to refresh the repo page in your browser and see your code up on GitHub. Now you're almost a world-famous programmer.

## WebGuesser

Next up let's work on the [WebGuesser project]({% page_url projects/web_guesser %}).
