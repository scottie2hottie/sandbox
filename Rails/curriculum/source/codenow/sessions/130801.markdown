## Merchant Next Steps

This week we've spent a good bit of time on JavaScript. Today let's make so serious progress on [the Merchant project](/projects/merchant.html). By the end of today it'd be great to have:

* Products and categories browsable
* The ability to add products to the cart
* Be able to manipulate quantities in the cart
* Be able to checkout

As a reminder, yesterday some of the ideas for integrating jQuery into your Merchant project included:

* Make the product description collapsable like you did with JSRights
* Insert a copyright line at the bottom of the page using jQuery that automatically fills in today's year (ex: "Copyright Jumpstart Lab, 2013")
* Create a "cheat code" for your store: if the user is on a product page and types your name into the keyboard, then the price drops to $0.01!

## JSTasker

This afternoon, let's return to the land of jQuery and work through [the JSTasker tutorial](/projects/javascript/jquery/jstasker.html)
