## Daily Outline

* Reviewing How Rails Works
  * Cookies & Authentication
* Finishing Base Blogger
* Finishing Idea Box
* TDD with EventManager

## Reviewing How Rails Works

Now that you have some experience with Rails, let's go over how all the pieces fit together and what they're doing.

* How a request cycles is processed
* How the components are connected
* What responsibilty each component has

### Cookies & Authentication

With that sequence fresh in your brains, let's talk about:

* What's a cookie?
* What kinds of things are stored in cookies?
* How do they get stored by the client/browser?
* How do they get sent back to the server?

## Base Blogger

Your Blogger projects are starting to get fully functional. During this session, let's get the base functionality finished including:

* Posting, editing, and deleting articles
* Posting and deleting comments
* Adding, editing, and browsing by tags
* Image attachments with Paperclip
* User authentication with Sorcery
* Securing the app so only logged in users can create, edit, or delete articles

## Finishing IdeaBox

Let's put one last work session into IdeaBox to make sure everything is clean and functional.

## TDD with EventManager

Do you remember waaaaay back when you worked on the EventManager project where you were working with the CSV data?

It's time to revisit that project, except this time you're going to use automated testing with a library named MiniTest.

### Intro to MiniTest

Let's start with a bit of background:

* Why do we write tests?
* What does a test look like?
* How and when do tests get run?
* What's the difference between "test after", "test first", and "test driven"?
* What kinds of things are easy to test, and what are hard?

### Reviewing EventManager

Take a few minutes to review the [EventManager project]({% page_url projects/eventmanager %}).

### Starting Fresh with MiniTest

The [TDD with MiniTest and EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/testing_event_manager.html) tutorial will get you going with MiniTest.

### Get 'er Done!

As much as possible, we want to see you implement this project on your own while using automated tests as your guide.
