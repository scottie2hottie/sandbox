## Daily Outline

* Getting Started with Exercism
* EventManager and TDD
* Blogger Extension: Adding Static Pages

## Getting Started with Exercism

Yesterday you got signed up with Exercism. It's a pretty cool system we're working on for giving feedback on code. 

This morning we're going to walk through how to complete, submit, get feedback, and react to that feedback.

### Instructor-Led Warmup

Now that you've seen and completed an exercise with Exercism, Steve will work through an example exercise and introduce you to some of the elements of Test-Driven Development.

## TDD with EventManager

Okay, yesterday we faked you out. Now you really have done EventManager!

Today we'll revisit that project, except this time you're going to use automated testing with a library named MiniTest.

### Intro to MiniTest

Let's start with a bit of background:

* Why do we write tests?
* What does a test look like?
* How and when do tests get run?
* What's the difference between "test after", "test first", and "test driven"?
* What kinds of things are easy to test, and what are hard?

### Reviewing EventManager

Take a few minutes to review the [EventManager project]({% page_url projects/eventmanager %}).

### Starting Fresh with MiniTest

The [TDD with MiniTest and EventManager](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/testing_event_manager.html) tutorial will get you going with MiniTest.

### Get 'er Done!

As much as possible, we want to see you implement this project on your own while using automated tests as your guide.

## Blogger Extension: Static Pages

Most company websites are a combination of a "news" page, like the blog you've already written, and a collection of static pages.

A "static" page is one that doesn't change often. If you were running a restaurant, you might have static pages like...

* A "Contact Us" page with the address and phone number
* A "Menu" page with all the foods available
* A "Our Story" page with the background of the restaurant
* A "Photos" page with great shots of the restaurant and the food.
