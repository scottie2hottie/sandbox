## IdeaBox: Editing and Deleting

This morning let's get going by adding functionality to our IdeaBox. [Hop over to the tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html#i2:-editing-and-destroying) and work through Iteration 2.

## Database Foundations @ Treehouse

Rails projects are almost always backed by a database to store and organize the data. So you need to learn a bit about how databases work.

Please work through the [Introduction to Data, Databases, and SQL](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations/introduction-to-data-databases-and-sql-2) track on Treehouse.

## Getting Started with Rails

This afternoon, let's dig into Rails (aka Ruby on Rails). We'll build a project that uses a lot of Rails' automation to get going quickly.

There's an organization named RailsGirls who works on getting more women involved in web programming. They have a short tutorial that'll run you through some of Rails' most fundamental concepts.

Work through [the RailsGirls tutorial here](http://guides.railsgirls.com/app/).
