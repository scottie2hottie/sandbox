## jQuery Recap

So yesterday you got a start in JavaScript. It's kinda tough, eh?

### Try jQuery

Remember when you did that introduction to Git? The team that put that tutorial together also has a great introduction to jQuery. Let's check it out:

http://try.jquery.com/

### Returning to JSRights

Interacting with the DOM isn't so easy. Yesterday you made some good strides with [the JSRights tutorial]{% page_url projects/javascript/jquery/jsrights %}, but let's go back to square one.

Please **delete your JSRights** from yesterday and let's start over. It should be a lot easier the second time!

## Merchant Next Steps

As you return to [the Merchant project]{% page_url projects/merchant %}, can you start to integrate some small jQuery features into your application? Here are a few ideas:

* Make the product description collapsable like you did with JSRights
* Insert a copyright line at the bottom of the page using jQuery that automatically fills in today's year (ex: "Copyright Jumpstart Lab, 2013")
* Create a "cheat code" for your store: if the user is on a product page and types your name into the keyboard, then the price drops to $0.01!
