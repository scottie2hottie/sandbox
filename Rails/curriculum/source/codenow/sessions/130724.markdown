## Digging into an Exercise

Steve will "pair program" with a student from the class to solve one of the warmup exercises.

## Aesthetic Foundations

Some people think that they're not good at drawing, and never will be. All art, like programming, is just a matter of practice.

This morning, let's put a little practice into design and learn about the basics on Treehouse:

* Elements: http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/aesthetic-foundations/elements
* Principles: http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/aesthetic-foundations/principles
* Color Theory: http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/aesthetic-foundations/color-theory

## Blogger: MiniTest and Rails

You've used MiniTest with Exercism, but now let's experiment with using it to guide our Rails development.

Hop over to [the Blogger tutorial]({% page_url projects/blogger %}) and go down to the last iteration.
