## Starting with jQuery

You've been building some cool applications in Ruby. But when it comes to the web, you need to add on another language, too: JavaScript. Over the coming days we'll dig into JavaScript while we continue to practice Ruby and Rails.

Today, let's start with a jQuery tutorial. jQuery is a library built on top of JavaScript that makes it much easier to manipulate elements on your web page.

### HelloJQ

In programming, we always start with a very simple program: outputting "Hello, World!" Let's do that with jQuery:

### JSRights

Now let's start to see what jQuery can do when we have a real page of text. Dig into the JSRights tutorial:

## Merchant Next Steps

With a bit of jQuery under our belts, let's return to the Merchant project. Complete Iteration 4 and 5 on your own:

When you finish, think about:

* Why was dealing with "double items" in an order tricky?
* If you decrease an item to a 0 quantity, does it get removed? What happens if you reduce it to a negative number?
* The tutorial doesn't use testing, but hopefully you are. What kinds of things are you testing in your application?
