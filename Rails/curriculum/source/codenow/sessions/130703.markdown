## Daily Outline

* Warmup
* Continue the Artist Project
* RubyWarrior Redux

## Artist Project

This morning we'll start with [the Artist project]({% page_url projects/process_artist %}). By the end of the morning you should have finished:

* The background setting
* At least one brush

## RubyWarrior

This afternoon, let's dig into RubyWarrior again.

If you felt **good** about where you were with RW yesterday, start fresh with an intermediate game.

If you felt **confused** about where you were yesterday, start a new beginner game and see if you can rock through the first six levels before we finish today.

## Retro & Demos

Lastly today we'll wrap up the week with:

* [Retrospective]({% page_url codenow/retrospectives/week_1.markdown %})
* Demos of RubyWarrior & ProcessArtist

Then have a great four-day weekend!
