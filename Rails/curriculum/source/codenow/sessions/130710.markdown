## Daily Outline

* Warmup
* Finishing WebGuesser
* Studying HTML

## Finishing WebGuesser

Let's finish up the [WebGuesser]({% page_url projects/web_guesser %}) project that you started yesterday.

If you finish all the features and extensions, make sure to spend some time cleaning up your code. Programming is about **both** the code's functionality and quality.

## Studying HTML

After WebGuesser, let's work on improving our HTML skills so we can build better web applications.

Hop over to Treehouse and complete the following units:

* [HTML Introduction](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/html/introduction)
* [HTML Text](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/html/text)
* [HTML Lists](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/html/lists)
* [HTML Links](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/html/links)

## Open Work Time

For the rest of today you're welcome to return to a project we've worked on and add features or improve the code. Possibilities to consider include:

* RubyWarrior - Can you attack the intermediate dungeon?
* Ruby Processing - Can you create some new sketches? Or build upon Process Artist with more functionality?
* Sinatra - Can you improve your number guessing game? Or maybe write an encoder/decoder for the web with a configurable rotation?
* Warmups - Try returning to one of the warmups we've worked on and completing it again, from scratch. Can you refactor the code for greater clarity?
