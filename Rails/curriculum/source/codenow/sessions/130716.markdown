## Finishing the RailsGirls Project

First up this morning, let's finish that RailsGirls project.

By the end of this session we want **everyone** done with the base project. And once you finish that, add on some of these components:

* Guide 1: [Adding Commenting](http://guides.railsgirls.com/commenting)
* Guide 4: [Creating Thumbnail Images for Uploads](http://guides.railsgirls.com/thumbnails)
* Guide 5: [Add Design with HTML and CSS](http://guides.railsgirls.com/design)
* Guide 6: [User Accounts](http://guides.railsgirls.com/devise/)
