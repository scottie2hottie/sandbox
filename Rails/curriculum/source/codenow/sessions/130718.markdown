## Ideabox: Refactoring

We've finished all the features of IdeaBox. But building software isn't just about making it work, it's important that we build it **right**.

This morning, we'll work on *refactoring* the application -- taking working code and improving the structure and clarity without reducing or adding new functionality.

Hop over to [Iteration 4: Refactoring the Project Structure](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/idea_box.html#i4:-refactoring-the-project-structure)

## How Data and Databases are Designed

In the Blogger project, we've so far gotten away without thinking much about our database. Let's talk about how the database is structured and why it's done that way including:

* Defining databases, tables, columns, and rows
* What a table looks like
* The conceptual model of how tables are "connected"
* The types of table connections:
  * one-to-one
  * one-to-many
  * many-to-many
* The role of foreign keys
* Finding connected rows across multiple tables

## Blogger Continued

Then let's dive back into Blogger. You should have articles and comments done and be working on the later iterations. 

If you're making quick progress, then look for opportunities to improve your code with *refactoring*.
