## Daily Outline

* Welcome, Steve!
* Continuing the Artist Project
* Getting Started with the Web + Sinatra

## Artist Project

This morning, let's press forward on [the ProcessArtist project]({% page_url projects/process_artist %}). 

### Where You Are

You should already have:

* Have background switching working
* Have one brush working

### Where You're Going

Through this morning, work on:

* Adding more brushes and brush switching
* Switching fills
* Changing the size of brushes

### And If You Finish

Work on improving the clarity and structure of your code.

* Can you pull out each brush into its own object or module?
* Can you cut down your use of `if` statements and instead use boolean logic?
* Can you get each of your methods down to **8 or fewer** lines?

## Getting Started with Sinatra

This afternoon we'll dive into building web applications with Sinatra.

### How the Web Works

First, Steve will explain to you how web clients and browsers work including:

* The client/server model
* What happens when you request a page in the client
* What the client expects to get back
* What the message looks like at the server
* What the server might do to construct the response
* What a response looks like

## Introducing Sinatra

Sinatra is a library that makes it easy to build web applications. Steve will introduce the basic concepts of Sinatra including:

* HTTP Verbs
* Routes and Matching
* Responses as text, HTML, and ERB
* Working with parameters

### Working On Your Own

Work through the "Singing with Sinatra" tutorial here: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/singing-with-sinatra/

### Going Further

Can you expand your example application to...

* Output the current time and date on the page
* Add a "decrypt" URL and functionality
* Use a ROT-13 encryption scheme like you built in the Encryptor project
