* 3:30-4:00 -- Closing & Cleanup

## Saturday

### Reviewing Pine Chapter 7

For homework you read Pine's Chapter 7. Let's go over some of the key ideas and work on the exercises together.

* Start on page 43 "Branching"
  * Review the idea of branching with `if`/`else`
  * Review and experiment with the sample code on page 48
* Continue on to "Looping"
  * Review the idea of looping with `while`
  * Review and experiment with the sample code on the bottom of page 50
  * Experiment with the `if`/`elsif`/`else` on page 52
* Exercises
  * As a group, work through the three exercises on page 57

### Exercise 31: Making Decisions

1. Read this short section on your own and type up the sample program. 
2. Make sure that the output matches the expected output in "What You Should See?"
3. Expand this game by adding your own possibilities and choices

### Learn to Program, Chapter 8

For our project tomorrow we need to be comfortable with Arrays. Let's practice them more using Chapter 8 from Learn to Program.

1. On your own, read the chapter and try each of the sample exercises
2. As a group, review `each` and how it is used
3. On your own, complete the "Building and Sorting an Array" exercise on the bottom of page 65

### Mindstorms Obstacle Course

1. Can you get your robot to complete the course?
2. What's the fastest time you can do it in?
3. You probably did it the easiest way, controlling your robots movements with certain numbers of rotations. Can you make the robot go forward based ONLY on sensors? That means instead of using "forward 3 rotations" you'd go forward inifinity rotations *UNTIL* a bump sensor, distance sensor, or light/color sensor interrupts it.

## Sunday

Today you'll spend the whole day on the Encryptor project which we'll distribute Sunday morning.
