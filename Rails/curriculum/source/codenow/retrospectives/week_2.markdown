title: Week 2 Retrospective
---

Let's spend a few minutes looking back at the week.

## Setup

* Use SublimeText to create a file `C:\Users\codenow\retrospectives\week_2.markdown`
* Write your retro in that text file

## Personal Retrospective

Spend the next 15 minutes answering one or more of the following questions:

### Subjects We've Studied

* So far you've studied pure Ruby, Ruby-Processing, and Sinatra. Which has been your favorite to work with? Why?
* How might you use the skills we've practiced so far on a project of your own?

### Yourself & Your Progress

* Now that we've been at it for a week and a half, do you feel like you're building momentum?
