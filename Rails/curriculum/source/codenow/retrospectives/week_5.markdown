title: Week 5 Retrospective
---

Let's spend a few minutes looking back at the week.

## Setup

* Use SublimeText to create a file `C:\Users\codenow\retrospectives\week_5.markdown`
* Write your retro in that text file

## Personal Retrospective

Spend the next 15 minutes answering one or more of the following questions:

### Subjects We've Studied

* What did you think of the Merchant project? What was hard about it? Were there parts that felt familiar from the Blogger project?
* Were you able to use automated testing while writing your Merchant project? Did it feel like it helped your development process?
* Now that you've spent some time with Rails, what do you think of it? Would you say it's "easy"?

### Yourself & Your Progress

* If you had three months to build an application before pitching it to Fred Wilson and his Y Combinator group, what would you build?
* We only have a little time left in CodeNow. How are you going to continue your learning once the program is over?
* Have your skills developed faster or slower than you expected? Why?
