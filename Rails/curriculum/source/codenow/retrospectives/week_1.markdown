Let's spend a few minutes looking back at the week.

## Setup

* Create a folder `C:\Users\codenow\retrospectives`
* Use SublimeText to create a file `C:\Users\codenow\retrospectives\week_1.markdown`
* Write your retro in that text file

## Personal Retrospective

Spend the next 15 minutes answering one or more of the following questions:

* Before this week you've spent at least six days learning Ruby.
  * Did you remember how to program?
  * What parts of this week were harder than you expected?
  * What parts were easy?
* Ruby Warrior
  * We spent a lot of time working on Ruby Warrior. Why?
  * Do you think a game is an effective way to learn? Why or why not?
  * We said that the "instructions were easy, the algorithm was hard" -- what did that mean? What's the difference between the instructions and the algorithm?
* Processing
  * What's easy in Processing? What's hard?
  * Why do you think we spent time working with Processing?
