title: Week 4 Retrospective
---

Let's spend a few minutes looking back at the week.

## Setup

* Use SublimeText to create a file `C:\Users\codenow\retrospectives\week_4.markdown`
* Write your retro in that text file

## Personal Retrospective

Spend the next 15 minutes answering one or more of the following questions:

### Subjects We've Studied

* The big thing this week was of course starting into automated testing. What do you think about using MiniTest? Do you think it helps you write better quality software?
* You've put a ton of work into your Blogger project. What features / challenges were interesting? What things are still confusing?
* Today you started a new Rails project. How did that feel? Is it feeling a bit more comfortable? Why?

### Yourself & Your Progress

* You've been doing some pair programming. Is it faster or slower than two people working independently? 
* If you ask questions of your peers, do you feel like you get good answers? If you answer questions, do you feel it helps your understanding of the topic?
* Were any of the guest speakers this week particularly memorable? Why?
