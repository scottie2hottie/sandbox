title: Week 3 Retrospective
---

Let's spend a few minutes looking back at the week.

## Setup

* Use SublimeText to create a file `C:\Users\codenow\retrospectives\week_3.markdown`
* Write your retro in that text file

## Personal Retrospective

Spend the next 15 minutes answering one or more of the following questions:

### Subjects We've Studied

* This week you dove into Rails. How did you experience with Ruby help you get going with Rails?
* Sinatra and Rails do basically the same job in different ways. Which did you like better? Why?
* What's one thing that's still confusing you about Ruby? Why?

### Yourself & Your Progress

* Are you dreaming up a web application you'd like to build? What would it do?
* What did you think of the guest speakers this week? What ideas or stories stuck with you?
* How does being in CodeNow compare to things other friends of yours are doing this summer? What's better and what's tougher?
