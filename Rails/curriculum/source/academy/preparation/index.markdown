title: Preparing for gSchool
---

Your gSchool class starts up in just a few weeks. Here's what we'd like you to do to get prepared:

## Typing

It might surprise you that **typing** is one of the most important skills during your first weeks of programming. If you need to look at your hands or type with just a few fingers, you're going to make so many small mistakes that it'll derail your progress.

We ask that from now through the start of the program, you spend 20-30 minutes *per day* practicing your typing. Even if you're a good typist now, this practice can really help you out. If you think you're good, check out Gary Bernhardt's ["Destroy All Software"](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts) (even the 1 minute sample video) to be put in your place.

Please create an account and do your practice on [Typing.io](http://typing.io), and work with the Ruby and JavaScript exercises they have. Go ahead and signup for the $5/month plan and we'll cut you the $5 in the first week of class. If you choose to use it beyond this month, the fee is up to you.

## Reading

We don't expect you to learn programming from books. If that were effective, you wouldn't be coming to the program. Instead, we use pre-reading to help you better understand the culture of development.

Please complete each of the following books by the start of class:

* [Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356344/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356344&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20) -- ideas about how to have a great career in software
* [How to Count by Steven Frank](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DPIKPE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005DPIKPE&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20) -- the underpinning theories of computing
* [Drive by Daniel Pink](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484805/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594484805&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20) -- how motivation does and doesn't work

While we won't have structured discussions or deliverables, you're encouraged to post your thoughts/ideas/feedback to the class mailing list.

### Optional

If that's not enough, here are a few additional ideas:

## Coding

If you'd like to start into some programming, here are easy places to start:

* [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) -- web-based exercises, you could try either Ruby or JavaScript tracks
* [RubyWarrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior/#/) -- web-based Ruby challenge
* [RubyMonk](http://rubymonk.com/) -- browser-based Ruby tutorials
* [Flatiron School's Prework](http://prework.flatironschool.com/) -- lists a ton of exercises and videos you might check out
