In this assessment you will:

* Build a web-based scrabble scoring calculator
* Use test-driven development
* Demonstrate mastery of all parts of the Rails stack
* Demonstrate mastery of Ruby throughout the process
* Effectively use Git and GitHub along the way

## Expectations

* Work on the exercise described below for 40 minutes with your facilitator
* The facilitator may change the spec or ask additional questions to assess your understandings/skills
* As you work, you *should*:
  * Think out loud so your facilitator can understand your process
  * Ask questions of your facilitator
  * Reference external public resources (ie: Google, Ruby API, etc)
  * Use the tooling most comfortable to you (Editor/IDE, testing framework, support tools like Guard, etc)
* As you work, you *should not*:
  * Copy code snippets other than those present in this description
  * Seek live support from individuals other than your facilitator
* After you complete the exercise, please use discretion with your classmates to allow them an authentic evaluation experience

## Preparation

Before the session starts:

* Have the [display driver installed](http://www.displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php)
* Fork the starter repo on GitHub: [https://github.com/gSchool/scrabble-web](https://github.com/gSchool/scrabble-web)
* Clone your fork to your computer
* Run `bundle` to install dependencies
* Run the test suite (`rake`) and see that it has several pending tests
* Setup any external tooling you want (your IDE, etc)

## Feature Description

For this exercise, the features will be driven by the test suite embedded in the repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby structures with a minimum of API reference, debugging, or support
* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby structures, but needs some support with method names/concepts or debugging syntax

* 1: Developer struggles with basic Ruby syntax
* 0: Developer is ineffective at writing any Ruby of substance

#### 2. Ruby Style

* 0: Developer is ineffective writing Ruby

#### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of API reference, debugging, or support
* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs guidance one what to use where

* 2: Developer writes tests after the fact or over-implements given a failing test
* 1: Developer writes tests that are ineffective or do not adequately exercise the functionality
* 0: Developer is unable to use TDD to drive development

#### 5. Workflow

* 4: Developer is able to effectively use Git, terminal, the file system, windowing, and the features (shortcuts) of their editor to get the work done
* 3: Developer is adequate at using Git, terminal, the file system, windowing, and the features of their editor, but has some inefficiencies
* 2: Developer shows holes in their understanding of everyday workflow tools and techniques
