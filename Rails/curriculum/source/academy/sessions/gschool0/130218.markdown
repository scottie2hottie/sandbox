## Warm-Up

Pull down the [warmup-exercises](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/warmup-exercises) repository at 8:50 for today's exercise.

## Classes, Modules, Variables, and Scope, Variables

During this session we'll do a lot of whiteboarding and small code examples. It's strongly recommended that you take notes.

### Defining Classes

* Inheritance
* The role of `Object`
* The concept of `self`

### Instance Methods

* `def`/`end`
* Act on an instance of the class
* Most common methods

### Class Methods

* Methods called without state
* Methods called on a general concept
* Why `self.`?
* Instances of Class

### Lookup Hierarchy

* Over and up
* `.superclass`
* `.ancestors`
* Inheritance overrides

### Variables

* The concept of scope
* Local Variables
* Instance Variables
* (Class Instance Variables)
* Class Variables
* Global Variables

### Modules

* Functional (instead of classes)
* Namespacing
* Reuse / organization

### Fun & Profit

* "metaprogramming"
* `send`
* `method_missing`
* `define_method`
* `define_singleton_method`
* methods with blocks
