Check out the submitted solutions for the exercise you created. Grade each submission:

3: Above and beyond
2: Good (default)
1: Disappointing
0: Not present

You should only award a three for work that is truely exceptional.

In addition, pick two exemplars which will become our "official" solutions.

### Lightning Talk Proposals

The subject is "testing philosophy, techniques, and tools" for Ruby and Rails. Talk about why we test, how we test, what tools we use, etc. It can be about unit testing, TDD/BDD, full-stack integration testing, why we used to say TATFT. Ask Matt if you have questions prior submitting a proposal.
