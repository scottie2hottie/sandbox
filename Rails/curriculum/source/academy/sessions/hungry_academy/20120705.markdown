### Individual Project Wrapup

If this project demonstrates your current skills and abilities, it had better look good. This morning, let's spend a little time polishing things up. 

Here are a few ideas:

#### Demoing Today?

If you're giving a demo this afternoon, layout and practice your content. If you're going to click on a city in a map, decide now which city, which vendor. If you're building a playlist, pick your input parameters. Don't "discover" things while you're in front of an audience.

If you finish that, continue...

#### Non-Demo Projects

1. Finish up that README. It should have a link to the live version, description of the value proposition, and explain the general architecture. What steps are necessary to run it locally? Run the tests?
2. Extract configuration. Do you have API keys floating around? Or short-term configuration data? Extract that into ENV variables and/or initializers.
3. Extract knowledge. The toughest one -- what's interesting about your application? How can someone other than you benefit from it? Perhaps leading into OSS time tomorrow, extract reusable code and release a gem, submit a pull request to a public project, or write a blog article about some interesting process/techique you used.

### Final Project Presentations

The notes the attendees will see are up at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/individual_project_reviews.html

#### Timing

We'll have 12 presentations this afternoon running in seven minute slots. You should present your app for up to five minutes, leave two minutes for evaluation, then a two minute transition.

#### Content

In your five-or-fewer minutes, explain:

* What's the value proposition?
* Who would use it? Why?
* Why did you build it?
* How does it work?
* Any particularly notable techniques or technologies?

Your audience doesn't care about:

* What you meant to do, but didn't
* The cards/technologies you started with
