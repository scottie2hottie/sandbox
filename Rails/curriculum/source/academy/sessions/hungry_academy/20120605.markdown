### Today

#### Morning

* Workshops
  * Web servers
  * Ruby servers
* Speaker: John Chenault

#### Afternoon

* Engineering Check-Ins
* Project Work Time
* SpeakerDeck Team Skype Call at 2PM
* Lightning Talk Thesis at 4PM

### Web Servers

* Web server's roles
* Why do you need it?
* Pros & Cons
* Options
  * Apache
  * NGINX
  * IIS (!)

#### Workshop Time

For the remainder of the hour, please work on installing and configuring one of the two web servers -- ideally whichever one you have *less* experience with.

* Configure Vagrant to forward your primary OS port 80 to your VM's port 80
* Configure your web server to respond on port 80
* In the VM:
  * Create a folder `/var/www/static/`
  * Create a file `index.html`
  * In the file, add this document:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Static World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

* Configure the web server so this file is displayed when you access http://localhost in your native OS browser

#### Groupings

* Apache with Mark in Classroom High
* Apache with Mike Silvis in Classroom Low
* NGINX with Conan & Dan in Board Room

### Ruby Servers

* Ruby server's roles
* Why do you need it?
* Pros & Cons
* Options
  * Webrick
  * Thin / Mongrel
  * Passenger
  * Unicorn
  * Puma

#### Workshop Time

Configure your front-end web server and underlying Ruby servers so that:

* http://localhost/ reaches the static page from before
* http://localhost/blog reaches an instance of JSBlogger (https://github.com/JumpstartLab/jsblogger_advanced)
* http://localhost/feed reaches an instance of SimpleFeed (https://github.com/JumpstartLab/simple_feed)

If you're really bold, get each app working with a different Ruby server.

We'll talk more about database servers tomorrow, in the meantime do whatever works to get the apps running -- probably using SQLite3 is the easiest.

#### Groupings

* Puma with Chris Maddox in the Fishbowl
* Unicorn with Ed in Classroom High
* Passenger with Horace in Classroom Low
* Thin with Travis in Boardroom
