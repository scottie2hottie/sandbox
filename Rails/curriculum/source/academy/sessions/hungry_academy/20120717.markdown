### Design Critique

#### C.R.A.P

* Contrast
  * How does color affect your attention?
  * How do different content elements contrast with each other? (Font type, size, color, style, etc)
  * Squint Test
* Repetition
  * Can you find the same cues repeated throughout the page?
  * Colors
  * Shapes
  * Shadings
  * Sizes
* Alignment
  * Does everything have a place?
  * Does the grid underly the entire page?
  * Is the grid broken? Intentionally? Does it work?
  * How is the horizontal alignment of text?
* Proximity
  * Is it always clear what goes with what?
  * Is there flow to the hierarchy?

### Real Software Engineering

LivingSocial Engineering's Glenn Vanderburg gave a few iterations of
a talk about the relationship between engineering and building software
over the last year, including a special version as a keynote at last year's
RailsConf.

This is a video from an earlier version of the talk, given at Scottish Ruby
Conference 2011. http://confreaks.com/videos/550-scotlandruby2011-real-software-engineering

### Architecture Review

Let's make sure that your architecture makes sense as you go into the final phase of work.

* Group 3: 1:00-1:25
* Group 1: 1:30-1:55
* Group 6: 2:00-2:25
* Group 5: 2:30-2:55
* Group 2: 3:00-3:25
* Group 4: 3:30-3:55

We want to answer questions like:

* How are your data models setup?
* How/when do you get any external data?
* What non-Ruby technologies are supporting your app? (Redis, Spine, etc)
* What performance bottlenecks will the site have?
