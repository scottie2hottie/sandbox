### Outline for Today

1. Finishing Your Project
2. Travis-CI
3. Peer Evaluations
3. Team Evaluation
4. Open Source Plan
5. Lightning Talks

### Finishing Your Project

* Finishing Base Expectations is the priority
* Wrapping your project into a gem
* Checking automated metrics:
  * Coverage
  * Cane `cane --style-glob 'lib/**/*.rb'`
  * Reek `reek . 2>&1 | grep "(LongMethod)"`
* Setup your project on Travis-CI
* Consider cloning your code and running tests from someone else's machine

*Reminder*: If your code doesn't run for your evaluator, it's a zero. Ouch!

### Travis-CI

Setting up a project for Continuous Integration on Travis is ridiculously easy. Let's go through the process once together.

http://travis-ci.org/

### Peer Evaluations

Here's the protocol for performing your peer evaluation:

* Open the form at http://eval.jumpstartlab.com titled "Peer Assessment for SalesEngine"
* Clone the repo to one of your machines
* Run the evaluation specs to determine *Correctness*
* Run their specs to determine the test coverage for *Testing*
* Run Cane and Reek to determine *Style*:
  * `cane --style-glob 'lib/**/*.rb'`
  * `reek . 2>&1 | grep "(LongMethod)"`
* Find their project in Travis (by searching) and determine the time it took to run the evaluation tests. Compare that to the reference time to determine *Performance*.
* Use previous findings to determine *Live Hungry*.
* Add _your own_ points for *Recognize Others*.

### Team Evaluations

Each of you then needs to complete a "Team Self-Assessment" at http://eval.jumpstartlab.com

### Etc

* Complete your Open Source Plan for tomorrow
* Work on your Lightning Talk
* Read *Drive*
