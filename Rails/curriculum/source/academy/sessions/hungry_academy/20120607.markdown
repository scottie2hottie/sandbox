* Bundler: `require "bundler/capistrano"` to deploy.rb

#### Workshop Time

* Install the `capistrano` gem on your local machine
    * May add it to the `development` group in your `Gemfile`
* Run `capify .` from the root of a project you want to deploy
    * Should be one of your group's project repos
* Configure the generated `Capfile` with the appropriate SCM details
* Configure the generated `Capfile` with settings for your local Vagrant virtual machine
    * Correct local IP or create a local DNS entry
    * Correct user credentials for the machine (DB, etc.)
    * Tasks for your infrastructure-specific setup (Nginx vs. Apache, Unicorn vs. Passenger, etc.)
* Use `cap` command to deploy to your local virtual machine
* Work together to repeat for your project's VPS

#### Groupings

Group with your project team but work on each of your local virtual machines. Work together to bring your local virtual machines in sync with your production VPS.

Be able to use the same Capfile, using the multistage extension, to deploy to your local virtual machine as well as your team's VPS.
