### Project Check-In

* Finishing Base Expectations is the priority
* Working out the kinks with evaluation process
* Wrapping your project into a gem
* Checking automated metrics:
  * Coverage
  * Cane - Style and ABC
  * Reek `reek . 2>&1 | grep "(LongMethod)"`

### Open Source Proposals

This week we have a little more time since there's no shadowing. Next week we'll review open source work together as a group, so build something you're proud of!

If if you're short on ideas, here are a few I'd like to see:

* Improve the documentation/site for Fabrication
* Styling of the Eval site
* Restructuring work on the indexes/listings of tutorials on http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com
* Conversion of the tutorials site to jekyll-bootstrap (?)
* New blog post(s)
* Add appropriate events to the site calendar
