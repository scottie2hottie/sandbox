6. Lightning Talk Plans

### Retrospective

You've completed your first project, first book, and half of you have given your first lightning talk. Let's spend a few minutes and reflect on:

1. What's one thing that stuck in your brain over the weekend?
2. What was the most frustrating thing you did last week? Did it get resolved? How?
3. What's a lesson you learned about strategy or work/life habits last week?
4. Who would you shout out for really standing out last week? Maybe they gave a great lightning talk, helped you with your project, or did great open source work.
5. Did you live up to your own expectations?

* Use RSpec to write a suite of at least 20 examples
* Try using "comment-driven development"

### Reading Group

We'll Skype with Jon Duckett, author of HTML & CSS. Below are some questions I plan to ask, feel free to add more:

#### The Book Itself

* Obviously the design of the book is very eye-catching and engaging, but different from almost every tech book out there. What were your motivations? Inspiration? Pushback from the publisher?
* A book about the web for technolgists -- and it isn't available in electronic form?
* For a print book, $17 on Amazon seems very cheap. Is that on purpose?

#### HTML5

* Do you think the branding of HTML5 has helped or hurt the technology's adoption? How?
* What do you think is really right in HTML5? Really wrong?

#### CSS

* Where do you stand on these "X implemented in CSS" projects? Do they provide value?
* Can we finally close the door on IE6?

#### Learning HTML & CSS

* Last week we had a demo of JSFiddle. Do you have any other great learning tools to recommend?

### Lightning Talk Plans

This week lightning talks will be delivered by:

* Nisarg Shah
* Mark Tabler
* Travis Valentine
* Austen Ito
* Elise Worthy
* Tom Kiefhaber
* Michael Verdi
* Daniel Kaufman
* Edward Weng
* Horace Williams
* Darrel Rivera
* Mary Cutrali

The theme this week is "Ruby, Rails, and Open Source Culture." What's something a developer new to the community needs to know about, understand, or appreciate?

You might tell the story of a community hero, project, or fiasco. Maybe explain some of our memes, cultural references, or rivalries. 

Be creative, but focus on delivering valuable knowledge.
