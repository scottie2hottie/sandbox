#### Open Source Plan

*Everyone* needs to complete an open source plan. Go to http://eval.jumpstartlab.com and look for the form.

You have about 4.5 hours for work on Friday. Make it count. Be realistic about what you're capable of completing. If you want to dig into code, do it. If you want to work on documentation, do that.

Some ideas:

* `EventManager`
  * Are there places that need better explanation?
  * Any errors?
  * Create a reference implementation with documentation
* `JSTwitter`
  * Add new iterations
  * Smooth out any issues you encountered
  * Post a reference implementation
* `OpenStruct`
  * Write an explanitary tutorial about OpenStruct
  * Include exercises
* `Evaluator`
  * Work on the `Evaluator` app to improve the design, workflow, etc
* Lightning Talks
  * Edit the lightning talk videos
  * Re-record lightning talks into tight, scripted screencasts
* Class Materials
  * Edit & publish screencasts
  * Write blog post(s) about activities
  * Work on the HungryAcademy.com site
* Miscellaneous Projects
  * Cane gem
  * JumpstartAuth gem

#### Lightning Talks

If you're giving a Lightning Talk this week, fill out the appropriate form on http://eval.jumpstartlab.com

Remember the theme is *Productivity*. Make sure that your talk is going to have some insights and takeaways. 
It's not a time to just list off a set of tools. See how much quality you can cram in 5 minutes. 

WHY is the tool/technique/trick good? Are there any competitors worth considering? How does it make your life easier?
If it weren't available, what would you do? Is it worth upgrading to paid versions/plans?

If you're using slides, consider the ratio of 15 seconds per slide, aka 20 slides.

Generally speaking, don't live code. It will always break. Instead, use a tool like ScreenFlow (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screenflow/id422025166?mt=12) 
or Xing (http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html) to record a screencast of you doing the thing, then talk over it live.

We'd like to publish these, so keep them highbrow and good looking. Include your name.

Lightning talk proposals will be approved by 6pm Tuesday.
