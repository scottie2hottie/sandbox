### Today

* Organizing the Final Push
* Metaprogramming
* Project Work

### Organizing the Final Push

* Gather into your groups
* Do a quick standup to understand your people status
  * Is everyone happy? Ready to work?
  * Do they have any conflicts or blockers today?
  * What hours are they planning to work?
  * How important is the success of the project to them?
* Work together on a priority list and schedule for the time between now and tomorrow morning
* Please don't write any code during this time, it's just for organizing.

#### Questions to Ask

* What features are **done**?
* What can't be finished or will take to much time relative to the business value? Cut it.
* What stories have we forgotten about?
* How are our users going to make mistakes? Do we guide them back to the right path?
* How long are each of our remaining to-dos going to take? You should be able to tell with +/- 1 hour accuracy at this point. If you're really not sure, it's probably too dangerous to schedule.
* When will we do the final Quality Assurance? How will we do it?
* Is it possible to have one person split off and be "the finisher"? They would clean up code formatting, check out Cane/Reek issues, maybe add documentation, work on the README, etc.

### Metaprogramming
