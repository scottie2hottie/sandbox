## Developing a Learning Track

The learning track would attract developers who self-identify as new to the community. Many attendees who would actually benefit from the content will be too embarassed by their lack of expertise to participate. The ones who show up will be those that aren't afraid to say "I'm new and I need help!"

For these persons, it makes the most sense to craft a hands-on, supported experience.

### Structural Plan

To not conflict with keynote sessions, the day will run from 11:30am to 5:45pm, Monday through Wednesday:

* 11:30 - 1:00 -- Session 1
* 1:00 - 2:00 -- Lunch
* 2:00 - 3:30 -- Session 2
* 3:30 - 4:00 -- Break
* 4:00 - 5:45 -- Session 3

#### Session Structure

Sessions should mix some lecture / content delivery with exercises:

* 25 minutes - Introduction & Goal Setting, Lecture / Example
* 5 minutes - Stretch / Questions
* 25 minutes - Guided Exercise
* 5 minutes - Stretch / Questions
* 25 minutes - Independent Work

### Content Ideas

#### Topics

* Day 1
  * Ruby in 100 Minutes
  * Scaffolding Rails
  * Relationships & ActiveRecord
* Day 2
  * ActiveRecord
  * Unit Testing Rails
  * Idioms with Ruby & ActiveSupport
* Day 3
  * Getting Started with Sinatra (?)
  * Full-Stack Testing from the Front-End
  * Fixing Common Security Holes - People from Stripe?
  * Basics of Providing a JSON API

### Attendance

Room 256 can hold 300-400 people, expect >150. Shoot for 1-to-20 ratio. Could offer tickets to volunteers, maybe for supporting three sessions.

### Content Plan

#### Day 1

Probably Jumpstart Lab instructors.

#### Day 2

#### Day 3

### People

1. Jeff Casimir, Jumpstart Lab
2. Frank Webber, Jumpstart Lab
3. Steve Klabnik, Jumpstart Lab

### What Will Go Wrong

#### Machine Setup

Configuration of dev machines is still difficult. Even if we know the steps, it may mean downloading large binaries over a thin pipe.

##### Possible Solutions

* Distributed USB drives with common needs
* Local network server for rubies, gems
* "Install fest" ahead of time
