## QuizRoom

I'm a teacher and technology is an important part of my class. Every student has a laptop, and I want to use a chatroom-based system for asking questons and tracking their answers.

As a teacher I can:

* Create a room
* Invite students
* Post a question with text and a time limit
* Decided whether responses are shared or hidden
* The question period ends when the timer expires or I click "move on"

Students can:

* Respond to the question
* Find out whether their answer was correct or not
* Get a score for responding correctly
* Student scores carry over across questions

## TripBuilder

We love traveling with friends and family, but building up the itinerary is such a pain. Everyone has different desires, ideas, needs, and it's hard to keep track.

I want to create a system where:

* I invite the trip participants to the trip room
* We can see the known pieces of the trip (flights, hotels, etc) in an itinerary
* We have a chat room where we can discuss ideas
* There's a way that we can "tag" parts of a conversation. So if we're discussing what we'll do on Tuesday, we can somehow click Tuesday in the itinerary and that snippet of the conversation will be attached to Tuesday for later viewing. 
* In the same way, we can chat about individual items within the itinerary

## Backchannel

Technologists love conferences and they love computers. Let's build a system that can be an organized, productive, informative "back channel" to a conference.

As an attendee, I join into the back channel and...

* Choose which conversation(s) I want to see: all or a certain room (or "track") of the conference
* Participate in a real-time chat with other attendees
* See events in the stream, like tweets tagged with the conference hashtag
* The schedule for today with info about speakers, slides, etc
* The ability to submit questions for the current speaker to answer during a Q&A
* The ability to vote up good questions other users have submitted

## RunTalk

Who uses computers anymore? Let's build a mobile chat system for people on the go. As a user I can:

* Create or join a room via my mobile browser
* Chat with others in the room
* Snap pictures that can be posted into the room
* Get push notifications when someone in the room mentions my username
* Easily post a "pin" of my current location

## WeTube

Turntable.fm is pretty cool, but looking at those little characters is boring. Let's build a collaborative music listening & watching service where I can:

* Create or join a room with friends
* We can watch music videos together
* Add music videos to a queue
* Have a chat room where we can discuss the music / video while it's playing
* Get a message in the room when a video begins
* "Favorite" videos, creating a list I can replay later

## SupportMe

Our users are demanding real-time support with our applications, but running a phone center is so inefficient. Let's build a real-time chat that can allow one support engineer to talk with mutliple customers.

As a customer, I can:

* Access a small embedded widget that says "Get Help" or access a direct link
* Start a chatroom
* Chat with a support representative
* Indicate whether or not my problem is resolved

As a support engineer, I can:

* See customers that are waiting for support
* Join up to six user conversations
* Chat with them
* Add links which are autolinked for the customer
* Upload files which are auto-inserted into the chat
* Request help from another support engineer (by username)
* Leave the chat

## WebRC

There are still people using IRC. Let's rebuild IRC for the web with a few ideas from web-based chat systems. 

As a user I can:

* Create and join multiple rooms simultaneously
* Start private conversations with any other user
* Leave a room
* Post URLs which are autolinked and the title (and maybe screenshot) dropped into the chat room
* Post image URLs which are automatically resized and embedded into the chat

The first person in a room is a "op". As an op, I can:

* make a room moderated where only ops and people with "voice" can chat
* make a room invite-only then send invites
* temporarily kick a user from the room
* ban a user from a room permanently

## TrivialChat

Bars and restaurants are always trying to figure out how to get people in the door. Let's build a trivia app where:

The bar can show a "big-screen mode" up on the TVs which shows the...

* Current questions
* Possible answers
* Timer for answers
* Score if answered at this moment

The trivia master has a screen where they can:

* Write or upload questions and answers
* Sort the questions
* Start each question manually
* Let questions run on a timer

Then, as patrons, we can:

* Join the trivia on a phone web browser
* Create a name for our team
* See the questions as they are released
* Respond by clicking one of the available answers

Then, between questions and between rounds, the question area is replaced by a realtime chat room where we can talk trash with the other teams.

## VoiceBridge

We love using chat rooms with our friends and colleagues, but having to type and read everything is so limiting. Not to mention that when we're driving, biking, or walking it's almost impossible to participate in the conversation.

Let's create a chat system that'd driven by voice. As a user I can:

* Create or join a room
* Type a normal text message
* Click the "Voice Post" button, then 
  * audio is recorded from my system microphone
  * audio is uploaded to the chat system
  * a transcribed text version of my sound byte is put into the room
  * others in the room hear my audio played (and can replay it with an icon next to the transcribed text)
* Hear text messages read by a synth voice
* Rewind and replay the previous messages
