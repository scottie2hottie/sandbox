## Evaluation Protocol

### Tagging the Final Release

Prior to the deadline, create a git tag to mark the commit signfying the release of your project to "production". Use the command `git tag -a release_v2` to create it and push it to your repo (with `git push --tags`).

### User Story Evaluations

In this section you'll break into two groups of three teams each.

Use the following protocol:

* Each pair presents their code/project for 5 or fewer minutes. Make sure to highlight any non-standard features or extensions and highlight and custom prioritizations in your Tracker project.
* Teams then evaluate both other projects for 30 minutes each:
    * Work through the evaluation user stories
    * Run the code metrics
    * Subjectively measure the UI and design
    * Submit one evaluation per project http://eval.jumpstartlab.com (so your team submits a total of two evals, one for each project you examine)

Be sure to split the responsibilities that can be done in parallel, but have at least two team members pairing on walking through the user stories.

While this is happening, code reviewers will be doing final assessments and scoring of the codebases.

### Project Presentations and Walkthroughs

Each team will present to the whole group and guests. You have seven minutes to show off:

* The basics
* What makes your project exceptional?
* What code or design refectoring did you perform, or testing improvements did you make to better the codebase?
* Anything else you're proud of?

Audience members will then be invited to try out your store for five minutes.

### Best Overall Shipper Awarded

Based on tallying various scores, the end product and its delivery, and the reading of tea leaves, one team will be chosen as the Best Overall Shipper of code.

### Wrapup / Retrospective

* Award your team points to each of your teammates
* What was challenging about this project?
* What came easy?
* What would you have done differently?
* Did you reach your goals? Why or why not?
* Any lessons learned for the next project?
