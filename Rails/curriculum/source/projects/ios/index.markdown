# iOS training

Learning to be an iOS developer is often a challenging enterprise because you
are presented with learning a new language, an entirely new framework, and a
new set of tools.

This program breaks down the complexities of entire process into small, understandable sections with an emphasis on shipping (code,build and run) software on your iOS device.

## Iteration 0

Within the first iteration we take some time to get to know the tools. Working with an existing project we focus on understanding the layout of Xcode, what are targets and configurations, and how to run software on the the simulator.

* Xcode
* iOS Simulator

## Iteration 1

Now it is time to start creating our own project. Here we will create a simple application utilizing Xcode's visual tools to build and wire components. While there we need to spend some time beginning to understand some of the Objective-C basics.

* Header Files
* Defining Headers
* Defining Properties
* Defining Method Prototypes
* Source Files
* Defining Classes
* Synthesizing properties
* Defining methods

* NSString, NSURL, and NSURLRequest
* UIView, UIWebview, and UIButton


## Iteration 2

Our application is simple. It's time to start adding some dynamic features that allow for more exciting navigation.

* Understanding the flow of your iOS application

* UIViewController
* Modal View Controller
* Navigation View Controller
* Tab Bar View Controller

## Iteration 3

It's time to see what our application looks like on a device. It's also time that we save our code and prepare it so we can more easily share it with others.

* Organizer
* Provisioning devices for development.
* Managing your projects in source control.

## Iteration 4

We got some feedback from our friends, co-workers, and product owners. They love it. But want a snappier menu and the ability to share with their friends. We could write this, but we found a few free libraries available to us.

* Integrating External Software and Libraries
* Code organization
* Using preprocessor directives
* Managing non-ARC plugins in an ARC world
* Converting ARC plugins in an a non-ARC world

## Iteration 5

A great service comes along once in a lifetime ... and we want to consume it. We want to build a rich client experience that is powered by service API.

* Processing JSON
* Mapping JSON to models with minimal effort
* Representing your data in a table
* Representing your data in a menu

## Iteration 6

We are tired of having to start over every time we launch the app from cold. It is time to add persistence of our settings making our application remember a user's configuration.

* Singleton classes
* Persisting data with NSUserDefaults
* NSNumber
* Boolean
* NSArray and NSMutableArray
* NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary


## Iteration 7

We are proud of what we have built. It is time to share it with more people. Let's give it to everyone on the team and their family members. It would be a great way to get feedback from more people.

* Apple Developer Website
* Setting up and managing certificates.
* Testflight Deployment Tools


## Additional Topics

### Advanced Objective-C

* Key-Value Coding
* Key-Value Observation
* Extending core classes with categories.

### Advanced UIKit

With the core of your app completed, it's time to give it that wow factor that gives it its signature.

* Key Frame Animating
* Core Graphics and Quartz Core
* Using external libraries
* Finding and importing components you find in the wild
* Creating your own custom components.
* Handling complex touch events
* Building components with extensibility in mind (delegates,class composition,sensible defaults)
