The goal of this project is to create an application that demonstrates the expertise you've built up so far in the course.

### Learning Goals

* Publish an API, with accompanying client gem, and consume your API internally.
* Continue to emphasize performance, UI, and overall user experience.

## Initial Process

You're responsible for creating your own project, but it is recommended that you collaborate with other students by:

* Having daily check-ins to explain and reality-check your progress
* Pairing program on each other's apps
* Reviewing code for quality and security
* Answering questions
* Researching challenging topics

### Constraints

To give you a bit of a technical challenge, we'll distribute several anchors for your project. 

1. Each student will receive 1 technology and 2 APIs integrations (ex: Riak, Twitter, and Instagram)
2. Each student will have three cards representing three of their own work hours
3. Students may then barter and exchange their cards
4. In the end, you must use two anchor cards (technology or integration) in your project

### Project Planning

You need to draft and have your project concept approved before beginning to write code:

* Fork and clone [the submissions repo](https://github.com/gSchool/submissions)
* Copy (do not rename) the
`/projects/individual_projects/lastname_firstname.rb` file and name it with
your own last name and first name
* Edit the file you just created to fill out all the required data. The `project_description` field should be a fairly short summary of your idea.
* Submit a pull request, entering your suggested MVP and how you intend to use the technologies/integrations for your project.

The pull request is where we are going to discuss whether or not your idea is good/complete/too big/too small/too vague.

If you have a huge idea and can break it into MVP and small iterations in the
pull request, we may go for it with the understanding that you probably won't
finish the whole thing.

## Expectations

You're expected to deliver a polished application that:

* Delivers value to the user
* Has an excellent, streamlined user experience
* Provides a JSON API
* Has a matching gem to easily work with that API
* Is built on Ruby 2.0
