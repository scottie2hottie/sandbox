title: Service-Oriented Rails

In this group project you'll build an appication which, behind the scenes, is made up of multiple "service" applications on the back-end.

## Big Picture

Let's build a communication tool centered around real-time chat.

### Planning & Direction

Instead of delivering you a collection of stories, you'll meet with us in a customer role and have to elicit the requirements out of us.

You'll take the notes and ideas from that meeting and use them to create your own stories, schedule them, and present them to the customer for approval.

### Systems Requirements

Your project must use each of the following:

* a blank VPS
* Web Server as Proxy (Apache, Nginx, etc)
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Pub/Sub service

### Architecture Requirements

Depending on the needs of your project, you might build services that handle each of the following responsibilities:

* Persistence
* Authentication
* Authorization
* Search
* File Manipulation
* Logging/Statistics
* Front-End
* API
* Websockets / Streaming

## How to Gather Requirements

* Identify key ideas
  * Concepts
  * Characteristics
  * Challenges
  * Characters
* Create an ubiquitous domain language
* Flesh out characters into personas
  * Motivations
  * Needs
* Hone focus via the "elevator pitch"
* Define the Minimum Viable Product
  * Prioritize user personas to service
  * Create a feature set sorted as "in" or "out"
* Develop user stories for "in" features
  * Validate with stakeholder/product owner
  * Prioritize stories, moving them "out" as needed
* Build wireframes for user stories

### Requirements Gathering

We'll put on our "customer hat" today to work with you on establishing requirements team-by-team.

Keep in mind that every conversation will be different, so you'll each have different requirements.
