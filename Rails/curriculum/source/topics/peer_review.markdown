## Peer Refactoring

When you're *not* doing code review with an instructor, it's time to help your classmates. You will:

* Clone the repository of a peer
* Refactor their existing code based on what you've learned through the evaluation process
* Submit a pull request
* Add or finish extensions as time allows
* Submit a second pull request

### Protocol

1. Find the repository for the project you're working on
2. Fork it in the GitHub interface
3. Get the HTTPS URL for your new repository
4. In your terminal, switch to your projects directory and clone the new repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thereponame.git`
5. Switch into that directory and see how things are working
6. Make your suggested changes (*note*: it'd be a good idea to find the person who peer evaluated the project (above) and ask them what issues they noticed)
7. Commit them to your local repo (`git add .` and `git commit -m "Refactoring"`)
8. Push them up to your GitHub repo (`git push origin master`)
9. Submit a pull request in the GitHub interface (big button near the top when looking at your fork's repository page)
10. Repeat 6-9 adding extensions as time allows.

It's expected that you'll have at least one pull request submitted by 4PM today.
