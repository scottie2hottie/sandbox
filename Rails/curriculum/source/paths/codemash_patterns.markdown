## Setting Expectations

### Is this the right session for you?

You belong here if:

* You feel *very* comfortable working with Ruby and Rails
* You have built several Rails projects
* You're interested in some new ideas
* You're willing to wrestle with things that might not work the first time

This is *not* a good session for you if:

* You're new to Ruby/Rails
* You were in my session this morning
* You want everything to go smoothly
* You only came for the "worker pattern", because I decided it didn't fit

### Are you prepared?

You need:

* To join the chatroom at http://jumpstartlab.com/chat
* Ruby 1.9.2 or greater
* Rails 3.1.3 or greater
* Setup the sample project

{% include custom/sample_project_advanced.html %}

You can also run the tests continuously as we make changes by starting `guard`

## The Plan

We're going to approach this in four segments of about one hour each.

## Contributing

You're strongly invited to help improve these tutorials, even while we're running the session. All the text is available on GitHub, so you can edit it right in the browser. Hit the "Feedback" tab on the left side of any page.

Enjoy!
