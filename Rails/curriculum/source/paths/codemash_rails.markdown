## Setting Expectations

### Is this the right session for you?

You belong here if:

* You're never worked with Rails
* You don't know about basic controller actions, view templates, and models
* You want to understand the basics of REST
* You'd like to go through the fundamentals

This is *not* a good session for you if:

* You are a Rails developer
* You think this is the "Advanced Patterns" session
* You don't want to try Ruby/Rails

### Are you prepared?

You need:

* To join the chatroom at http://jumpstartlab.com/chat
* Ruby 1.9.2 or greater
* Rails 3.1.3 or greater
* To open *three* terminal or command prompt windows and change into someplace you want to store your projects

## The Plan

We're going to follow the first parts of a long tutorial available here:

http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html

## Contributing

You're strongly invited to help improve these tutorials, even while we're running the session. All the text is available on GitHub, so you can edit it right in the browser. Hit the "Feedback" tab on the left side of any page.

Enjoy!
