#### Andy Hunt's [Pragmatic Thinking & Learning](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356050&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you'd like something less technical, this book is rich with ideas about how to learn effectively -- especially as a developer.

#### Bob Martin's [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

Uncle Bob helped start agile software development and this text lays out his plan for how to build great applications. Not tied to any specific language, this is about how build software that lasts.
