### Daniel Kohoe [Learn-Rails](http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html)
This book is ideal for beginners as Daniel does a great job of building things up from the ground. He explains fundamental web development concepts and really helps you understand how the web works and the benefits of using Rails as a web development framework. One of the things I really liked about the book was the authors explanation of the web response and request cycle. 
It is a very basic book and is only geared towards people that don't feel comfortable using Rails.

#### Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=4.0#top)

The Rails Tutorial is one of the most popular texts for learning Rails has been updated for Rails 4. It takes the approach of building a sample app and tying in all the key concepts. It integrates testing throughout, but it's done in RSpec.

This text is only available in electronic editions, but it is free.

#### Bruce Williams & John Athayde's [The Rails View](http://www.amazon.com/The-Rails-View-Maintainable-Experience/dp/1934356875/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&qid=1382969067&sr=8-14&keywords=rails)

This intermediate text is a good choice if you feel comfortable building basic Rails applications and would like to focus on ways to build modular, maintainable view-layer code. Note that it targets Rails 3, but differences should be minor.

#### Leonard Richardson's [RESTful Web Services](http://www.amazon.com/Restful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1382972055&sr=1-3&keywords=REST)

This text is ancient in the tech world, but it was one of the first to really open the door to RESTful web architecture. This is a good fit for you if you feel comfortable building basic Rails applications, but want to understand more about how to model more complex domains without tripping over yourself.

#### Jose Valim's [Crafting Rails 4 Applications](http://pragprog.com/book/jvrails2/crafting-rails-4-applications)

This is an advanced text for those who have built several Rails applications. The Rails 4 edition is only available as a beta PDF at this time.
