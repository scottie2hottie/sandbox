#### Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593272820/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593272820&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

A book targeted at the true fundamentals of the language. The focus is *not* really on the browser and DOM. This book would be a good choice if JavaScript feels a bit overwhelming and you'd like to take small steps.

This book is also available [free online](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

#### Tim Wright's [Learning JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321832744/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321832744&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

This text is more web-focused and has you diving into the Browser/DOM right away. This is a good middle-of-the-road text if the work we've done in class feels OK and you want to apply the techniques to real web applications.

#### Earle Castledine and Craig Sharkie's [jQuery: Novice to Ninja](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0987153013/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0987153013&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

Even with very little understanding of JavaScript you can do some pretty amazing things with jQuery. Reading this book is kind of like skipping past Ruby and going straight into a Rails book. The text is friendly and easy to read. You'll learn to quickly build useful features in a web context, but you won't understand everything that's going on.

#### Stoyan Stefanov's [JavaScript Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596806752/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596806752&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If JavaScript fundamentals are feeling solid, this is an excellent book about how to really take advantage of the language. This is almost like the "Eloquent Ruby" of JavaScript -- a collection of the techniques you need to build maintainable, excellent code.
