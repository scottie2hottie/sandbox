#### Jon Duckett's [HTML & CSS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118008189/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1118008189&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you aren't very familiar with HTML and CSS, this is an excellent introduction to each of the components and their usage. It's really well designed, but is laid out more as a reference than a story. It's kind of like reading a very beautiful, well-written dictionary. If you like reading in short bursts, this is a good fit.

#### Elisabeth Robson's [Head First HTML & CSS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596159900/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596159900&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

Head First books are different than any other technical book -- you'll love it or hate it. Take a look at the sample pages before selecting this one.

This book is a good fit if you've either (a) never done anything with HTML/CSS or (b) feel like your foundation is shaky.

#### A Book Apart's CSS3 and HTML5 Books

#### Dan Cedarholm's [Bulletproof Web
Design](http://astore.amazon.com/simplebits-20/detail/0321808355)

Dan Cedarholm has written multiple books regarding solid html/css practices.
Bulletproof Web Design goes over html/css topics by showing an example of how
a current website implements a solution - and then explains why that solution is
not "bulletproof" - essentially why it could break in the real world. 

He then will show you true bulletproof solutions to the problem given, and how
to implement them.

This book is great for those already comfortable with html/css and would like to
know how to build stronger markup/style foundations in their websites.


#### Brian Miller's [Above the Fold](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144030842X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=144030842X&linkCode=as2&tag=jumplab-20)

If you've got a decent toolbox of HTML and CSS knowledge, then the next challenge is how to design sites/applications from a high level. This book steps above the implementation nuts and bolts and focuses on the *why* in web design.
