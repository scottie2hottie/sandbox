title: Remote Pairing
---

If you're joining us for a remote pairing session, please prepare the following:

#### Network Connection

If at all possible, please connect your computer to the network via hard-line ethernet. The choppiness of wireless connections can really interrupt the flow of pairing.

#### Primary Communication: ScreenHero

Download and setup an account on [ScreenHero](http://screenhero.com/), which allows us to share and interact with your desktop.

You can add us to your contact list:

* Frank Webber is franklin@jumpstartlab.com
* Jeff Casimir is jeff@jumpstartlab.com

#### Secondary Communication: Skype

Download and setup an account on [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/). We'll sometimes fall back to Skype if there are problems with ScreenHero. The desktop sharing is not interactive, so it's less preferred.

#### Development Environment

We presume that you'll be working with and have setup:

* Ruby / Rails / JavaScript as needed
* An editor like SublimeText, Vim, or RubyMine
* Whatever code you want to explore

That's it, we hope you enjoy the sessions.
