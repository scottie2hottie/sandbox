### Daniel Kaufman

* Technologies: S3, Raphael.js
* Integrations: Last.FM, gCal
* LivingSocial: 918 F. Street
* Concept: Bar Trivia

* 1. What problem is it going to solve?
   918 is looking for more ways to get people in the building, more consistently. Bar trivia would bring additional people into the bar space, without any additional cost. However, in doing so, Living Social should make sure to differentiate themselves from they typical DC bar that does trivia on weeknights. One way to do so is with a sleek, modern trivia experience that would stand in sharp contrast to the typical clumsy method.

* 2. Elevator Pitch:
  LivingSocial is a cutting edge tech company and a leader in local events, and the way they do trivia should reflect this. Currently basically all bar trivia is run with scraps of paper and excel spreadsheets. Each question starts with people shouting at the organizer to repeat the question. Then, each team scrambles to write their team name and answer on a scrap of paper, without much idea of how long they have. Finally, one member of the group must fight his or her way through the crowd to hand the answer to the organizer. Scores are tallied in an Excel spreadsheet, with plenty of errors and wait times. LivingSocial, in contrast, can offer a sleek, technological solution, where players can use their mobile phones to read questions, submit answers without rushing across the room, and know their scores instantly.

* 3. Core Features
  a. A lightweight front facing website that updates automatically to display new questions and when the time to answer questions is over.
  b. A more robust dashboard view for the organizer, which could also be displayed on a big screen at the bar.
  c. Realtime communication between the two above components.

### Tom Kiefhaber

* Technologies:  jQuery Mobile, Elasticsearch
* Integrations:  Spotify, Netflix
* LivingSocial:  Takeout & Delivery
* Concept:  Date night.  
* Problem:  LS is all about curating experience, but T&D more transactional.  Seamless can deliver food.  We need to make ordering food more just another meal.
* Elevator: What goes better with Good Fellas than some lasagna and garlic bread?  Got a hankering for some tandoori chicken?  Spice it up with some Slumdog Millionaire.
            We're going to transcend your night on the couch into a night you'll never forget.
* Core Features:  Fetch currently available menus and categories, access netflix for genre search. In the future? Spotify playlists.

### Jan Koszewski

* Technologies: Websockets, Processing.js
* Integrations: Twitter, Gmail
* LivingSocial: Local Deals
* Concept: Local Deal Twitter Feed Analytic Tool
* Planning:
  1. Problem: Measuring a Deal's impact through social media and meaningfully engaging with people who talk about a Local Deals is difficult.  There is no tool that quickly synthesizes, assesses, and gives feedback about a Deal's performance leveraged against its social media presence in real-time.
  2. Elevator: Quickly guage the twitter impact of a Deal in real-time; see who is tweeting about a deal and their social media presence as measured by their Klout score leveraged against the performance of the deal overall.  Strategically engage with people who tweet about a deal to boost that deal's overall success and @livingsocial's profile.
  3. Core Features: It must be able to (1) retrieve tweets about a specific deal in real-time (or match tweets to @livingsocial against a specific Local Deal), (2) retrieve the Klout score for the person or organizatoin who tweeted about the deal, (3) periodically scrape the livingsocial.com/cities.atom feed to retrieve purchasing data about all Local Deals being run for the day, and (4) visually present the collected information about a the twitterer and the deal in a way that is at once meaningful and useful to people who manage the social media presence of a Local Deal.

* Technologies: Big Data, >= 3 programming languages
* Integrations: Twitter, Amazon Marketplace
* LivingSocial: Local Deals
* Planning
  + Problem: LivingSocial has some of the greatest engineers on the planet, and yet our core business is sales and advertising. We send out 1 deal/market/day, but I don't need 70% of what they send me.
  + Pitch: Let's start building verticals that don't have to do with deals, but that drives taffic to our core business. We can get tons of user data for better personalization by encouraging users to integrate their social networks with us.
  + Core Features: Twitter, Facebook, Deals integration (as ads).

### Conan Rimmer

* Technologies: node.js, couchdb
* Integrations: twitter, google maps
* LivingSocial: takeout and delivery
* Concept: Last-Minute Get Together
* Planning:

  1. Problem: It is difficult to coordinate groups for an impromptu dinner party. Ease the situation by giving users the ability to pick a restaurant from T&D then send invites over twitter, and if enough people respond to it within a certain time, provide options for picking up party favors (ordering food through takeout and delivery, decorations, etc.)

  2. Elevator: No one likes eating alone, and no one likes last-minute planning. By using "PartyPlanner", you can pick out a food type for dinner then send out an invite through twitter. If enough people do reply within a certain timeframe, receive information on where to pick up food, decorations, etc; if enough people do not reply, no energy was wasted on setting up the party.

  3. Core Features: It must allow users to signin and post using Twitter.  It must also retrieve info from LS site about restaurants available for T&D. To keep with the time branding, it must also have a countdown upon post. It must also consume replies to know if enough people have responded.  Upon response, it must show where to pick up items around his or her area using google maps.

### Mark Tabler

* Technologies: SOA, Multi-Host Distributed System

* Planning:
  1. Problem: It's too easy to spend an hour every morning surfing a collection of sites looking for interesting news, and still miss pieces you'd have liked to know.

  3. Core Features: A search for a given city returns info on weather, local deals, job activity, where people hang out, and what they care about.
